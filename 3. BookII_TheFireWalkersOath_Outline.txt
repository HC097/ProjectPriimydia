BOOK II: The Fire-Walkers’ Oath
===============================

The Guardians cross the threshold. Each enters a divine realm. Each kills a god. And each is changed.

Thematic Arc:
-------------
This book explores what it means to walk into divinity with human hands — and what it costs to return. It is a meditation on war, duty, isolation, and transformation. It ends not in triumph, but in separation.
