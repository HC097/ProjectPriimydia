BOOK III: The Stone That Looped the World
=========================================

The Guardians have vanished, the gods are dead, but reality is unraveling. Priotheer must act to seal the world — and bear the burden of isolation.

Thematic Arc:
-------------
This book explores the consequences of divine war: the physical and metaphysical disintegration of reality, the grief of survivors, and the cost of containment. It ends with Priotheer creating the Wall, exiling the world from itself to prevent annihilation.
