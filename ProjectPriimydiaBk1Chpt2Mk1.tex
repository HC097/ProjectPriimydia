\section*{Segment 1: The Founding of The First City}

Before the chisel, before the archive, before even the word “Priimydia” was etched into stone — there was the gathering.

Not a settlement. Not yet.  
But a gravitational stillness around the Tree.

The Stone Tree did not command. It did not demand.  
But those who stood near its base felt the Pattern echo through their breath.  
Speech slowed. Memory sharpened.  
Some began to stack stones — not for shelter, but for resonance.  
Others traced the ground with ash and chalk, mapping lines they felt but could not explain.

It began as symmetry.  
Then rhythm.  
Then threshold.

No king declared the city.  
No walls defined it.

But one morning, as the sun struck the topmost branch of the Tree, the light refracted and split —  
casting five distinct shadows across the valley floor.

They pointed outward, toward the distant realms.  
And inward, toward the center of all that was becoming.

That day, the people knelt — not in worship, but in recognition.  
They knew something had taken root.  
Not just stone.  
But \textbf{order}.

They began to build.

Not upward, but outward.  
Streets spiraled around the Tree.  
Homes were raised in concentric folds, each layer closer to song.

There were no scripts.  
But the stones began to sing.

The lowest circle housed the gatherers — those who spoke little, but knew how to echo.  
The next ring held the Rememberers — those who could shape stone to hum with meaning.  
And at the center, beneath the Tree, was the Circle of Listening.

Not a throne.  
A floor.  
Carved with rings like the Tree itself.  
Here, each voice was heard not by volume, but by stillness.

It was not government.  
It was memory, structured.

And in the midst of that memory, Priotheer stood watch.  
He did not speak.  
But when he walked, his footsteps aligned the dust.  
When he touched stone, songs ceased — not in fear, but in reverence.

He did not command the builders.  
But none built out of rhythm.

And so the First City was not declared finished.  
It was never finished.

It was alive.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 2: The Stone Tree and the Roots of Law}

The Stone Tree did not bear fruit, but it bore rhythm.

Its roots spiraled deeper than anyone could map.  
Some said they reached the edges of the five realms.  
Others claimed they pulsed with the last stillness of the Demiurge.  
But all agreed on one truth:

When the Tree’s rings were counted aloud — not read, but recited —  
the city remembered.

That is how the first laws were born.  
Not written, but sung.

They were called \textbf{the Meletheia} — not laws in the punitive sense,  
but rhythms that returned things to alignment.

If a child struck his brother, the Circle of Listening would not ask why.  
They would ask what note had been lost — what rhythm had fractured.  
The child would then sit in silence and be retaught the Pattern through chant.

No prisons.  
No punishments.

Correction was not about guilt.  
It was about resonance.

To guide this memory, the first Order was formed:  
the \textbf{Priests of Memory}.

They did not preach.  
They recorded — not with ink, but with tone.  
Each priest was trained to memorize a different ring of the Tree’s chronology.  
Some held the chants of founding.  
Others the sounds of forgetting.

Their robes bore concentric circles, stitched in clay-dye and ash.  
When they walked through the streets, citizens would fall silent —  
not from fear,  
but from the instinct to remember.

They did not speak unless asked.  
But when they did, their words carried a weight that could still a riot.  
Not from power.  
But from precision.

They knew the old sound.  
And when spoken in alignment, that sound could undo confusion.

In time, their memory became more than liturgy.  
It became precedent.  
And precedent became settlement.  
And settlement became tradition.

Some began to push for more clarity —  
to transcribe the Meletheia into script,  
to systematize what had always been lived.

But Priotheer refused.

“Ink breaks rhythm,” he said.

“Let the Pattern live in flesh.”

And for a time, it did.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 3: The Singing Temples and the Withheld Answer}

The first temple was not built.  
It was sung into being.

They found a hill where the wind echoed just right —  
where the air held tone like breath held prayer.  
There, the Priests of Memory stood in a ring, each chanting a different ring of the Stone Tree.  
The ground beneath them did not shake.  
It listened.

Over weeks, the earth settled into a hollow — not carved, but yielded.  
Stone met sound and folded inward.

They called it \textbf{the Chamber of Refrain}.  
It had no roof.  
Its walls curved like cupped hands.  
When one stood in the center and whispered,  
the walls returned the voice not as it was —  
but as it had once been offered.

It was said the Chamber could recall the words one had truly meant.  
But only if they had been meant in love.

Temples followed.  
One for each realm-shadow.  
Not altars, but vessels —  
hollowed resonance for the sacred ache left behind by the One.

They did not build toward gods.  
They built toward remembrance.  
And through remembrance, devotion.

They sang not only to remember,  
but to give thanks —  
to the One who uttered them into being,  
and to the Demiurge who shaped them with quiet fire.

Each temple bore a name and a song:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Temple of Iron} — for judgment, sung in unison, without harmony.
\item \textbf{The Temple of Wind} — for longing, whose columns chime in silence.
\item \textbf{The Temple of Earth} — for covenant, where chants are etched into soil.
\item \textbf{The Temple of Water} — for grief, where hymns change with every voice.
\item \textbf{The Temple of Silence} — for what could not be sung at all.
\end{itemize}

The Priests of Memory expanded.  
But something shifted.

They began to assign chants.  
To sort children by harmonic signature.  
To correct dissonance by ritual repetition.

Some called it sacred alignment.  
Others felt the edge of something colder.

Still, the city listened.

And Priotheer —  
he watched.

At dusk, he entered the Chamber of Refrain.  
He placed his hand on the centerstone and spoke a word he had spoken only once before.  
A word that had once drawn light from the sky.

The Chamber did not answer.

Not because the word was wrong —  
but because the city no longer remembered who it was meant for.

He left without a sound.

And somewhere, far below the Tree,  
a root bent — not in error,  
but in grief.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 4: Priotheer Becomes King of Flame and Reason}

Priotheer had never ruled.

He had listened. He had walked. He had aligned stone by silence.  
But now the air trembled with a pressure it had never known — not dissonance, but demand.

A fracture had emerged — small, but sharp.  
Two families disputed the same chant — each claiming to remember it rightly.  
The Priests of Memory could not agree.  
The Temple of Iron hummed off-key for the first time in recorded rhythm.

It was not a riot.  
But it was something older: the beginning of judgment.

The Circle of Listening convened.  
They did not summon Priotheer.  
He simply walked in, and the room aligned around him.

He heard both chants.  
He stepped into the center ring.  
He closed his eyes, and he remembered — not the sound, but the moment when the chant was first sung.

Then, with voice quiet and clear, he recited the original line.  
Both families wept.  
The Temple realigned.

No one declared him king.  
But from that day, they began to call him \textbf{First Flame} —  
for he remembered before memory,  
and judged not from power, but from pattern.

Still, titles did not shape him.  
It was what came next that did.

In the dark season, when the sun curved lowest, a sickness came.  
Not of body — but of fire.

Children were born without resonance.  
Their voices cracked the Pattern.  
The Temple of Silence echoed too loudly.

Panic spread.  
Not in screams — but in broken rhythm.  
Memory no longer healed. It confused.

Priotheer did not panic.

He climbed the Tree.

No one had ever done so.  
Its bark was stone. Its branches not made for hands.  
But he climbed — slowly, in silence, until he reached the high hollow where no sound returned.

He sat for three days.  
He did not eat.  
He did not pray.

On the fourth day, light came — not from above, but from within.  
He opened his hands and flame emerged.  
But it did not burn.

It shimmered like memory before speech.  
It whispered without voice.

He took it.  
Held it to his chest.  
And descended.

When he returned, the children sang again.  
Their voices rejoined the Pattern.  
The Priests of Memory fell silent as he passed.

From that day, they began to build not only temples, but laws.  
Not just from chant — but from clarity.

And though he wore no crown, Priotheer became  
\textbf{King of Flame and Reason}.
