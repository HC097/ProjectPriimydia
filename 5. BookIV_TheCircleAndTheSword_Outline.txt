BOOK IV: The Circle and the Sword
=================================

The world forgets what it was saved from. The Republic rises and fails. A blade is hidden. And a system built on purity prepares to fall inward.

Thematic Arc:
-------------
This book traces the long descent from post-mythic democracy into mechanized tyranny. It explores how fear corrupts reason, how purification justifies violence, and how a sword meant to restore balance is forgotten beneath growing machines.
