\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Doctrine of Alignment} \\
    In the newly built city of Elsewhere, Anytus establishes the Mandate of the Five — a structure of order, division, and daily recitation. It is not built on memory, but on speech. Priotheer is referenced only as absence.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{The Possession Deepens} \\
    Anytus begins to change. His voice becomes layered. Correctors begin to appear without orders. Priests record words he does not remember saying. The gods do not speak aloud — they echo within.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{The First Correction} \\
    During a public rite, a girl sings off-rhythm. A Corrector steps forward. She collapses without mark. Her father is given a scroll of judgment. She is not returned. Anytus approves.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{Memory's Hidden Strength} \\
    Spirals begin appearing — in chalk, in char, in fire. Children hum forgotten chants. Correctors fail to suppress them. Priotheer walks unnoticed, tracing the ancient spiral paths beneath the dust.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{A Name Left Unspoken} \\
    Without decree or rebellion, the people return to the spiral. They form it with their bodies. Priotheer appears. A Corrector speaks in five voices. Priotheer silences him with touch. All kneel.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{The Final Gesture} \\
    Anytus remains alone. He declares himself the vessel of the gods. He ignites the flame-braziers and walks into them. His body disappears. The Pattern does not.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{Restoration} \\
    The priests of memory return. The city breathes. Priotheer kneels at the place where Anytus burned. No throne. No title. Only silence — shared and sacred.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{Now to War} \\
    Priotheer descends into the Temple of Stone. He places five stones on the altar — one for each realm. The gods will not allow memory to remain. The Fire-Walkers will be chosen.

\section*{Segment 1: The Doctrine of Alignment}

The city of Elsewhere awoke to perfect silence.

Not the reverent hush of memory, nor the contemplative stillness of the old Meletheia. This silence was curated, imposed—engineered by discipline. At dawn, the five bells tolled not in harmony, but in sequence. One for each god, none overlapping. Above every threshold, the day's rite was posted: \textit{“To speak out of rhythm is to delay the Pattern’s return.”}

Children gathered in the plaza, their hands clasped behind their backs, their shoulders rigid with rehearsed stillness. One by one, they recited the Dawn Invocation—each word a note, each breath a measure. No laughter. No birdsong. Only voice, and the emptiness between it.

From the high platform at the city’s center, Anytus watched. He wore white trimmed in black flame, a robe neither priestly nor martial, but something colder—administrative. He did not raise his voice. He had not needed to in months.

“Very good,” he said. “Let the gods see our shape.”

Correctors lined the edges of the square, robed in ash-gray, faces concealed beneath smooth iron masks etched with the five-fold sigil. They carried no weapons. Their hands were empty. But when they moved, even the stone seemed to flinch.

A small boy faltered in the third line—his syllable hung too long, the beat misaligned. One of the Correctors stepped forward, silent as shadow. A flick of the hand, a twist of the wrist, and the boy was marked with a stripe of cold ash along the cheek. He did not cry. His mother did not protest.

Anytus nodded. “Correction is not cruelty,” he said. “It is rhythm enforced.”

Then, just for a breath, Anytus frowned. The boy reminded him of someone. A face blurred by time—someone who had once sung the Meletheia in joy, not fear. But the Pattern demanded symmetry, not sentiment. The memory passed.

The people had begun to repeat his words in private, and then in public, until they passed from repetition into belief. Correction is not cruelty. Correction is not cruelty.

As the sun crested the eastern spire, Anytus turned to descend the platform. One of the younger priests approached him hesitantly, scrolls in hand, sweat streaking his brow.

“Lord Anytus, there have been murmurs in the northern quarter. Old chants—echoes of the Tree’s path. They’re not sanctioned.”

Anytus did not look at him. “Echoes are not alignment,” he said. “They are memory unmeasured.”

“But should we—”

“Do nothing,” Anytus whispered, eyes narrowing. “They will sing themselves silent.”

The priest bowed and retreated.

From the edge of the plaza, a girl knelt beside a drainage groove and began to draw something in the dust with her finger. A Corrector approached, stopped, and stared. She was writing in spirals—three-armed, coiled inward, like a song folding into itself.

The Corrector raised his hand, paused—then lowered it. The girl looked up. Their eyes met through the slotted mask.

Neither spoke.

The city moved on around them, in steps and syllables, while far above, the wind passed through the god-spires and did not echo once.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 2: The Possession Deepens}

Anytus had stopped dreaming three nights ago.

Sleep came, but brought no images—only light. Not warm light, but pure alignment: blinding, harmonic, total. 

He would wake with blood on his pillow from where his nose had bled, unaware. His servants did not speak of it. They had begun to dream the same.

In the Mandate chamber, five braziers burned before five gates, each marked with the sigil of a god. Anytus stood in their center. 

His voice had begun to echo—not into the chamber, but back into himself. He would speak a sentence and hear the end of it before it left his mouth.

“It is time,” he said.

The chamber replied, “It is time.”

He was no longer certain which voice had spoken first.

He blinked hard, suddenly unsure whether he had spoken aloud at all.

The priests watched him now with reverence and fear. They wrote down his words, not as commands, but as scripture. One recorded a phrase Anytus had no memory of saying: \textit{“To resist the chorus is to fracture the soul.”} He had written it in flame-script, blinking back tears as he did.

Outside, in the streets, Correctors had begun to appear unbidden.

No orders. 
No scrolls. 

They emerged from shadowed places—basements, alleys, even wells. When questioned, they gave no name. But all moved as if receiving the same instruction, silent and absolute.

Anytus held counsel that evening in the Hall of Alignment. 

Fourteen chairs stood empty. 

Those who remained sat straight-backed and mute, eyes wide and unfocused. 

One of them, the High Archivist, spoke without inflection: “Your will has multiplied, my lord.”

“We no longer wait for words. We move when the silence stirs.”

Anytus nodded slowly. “It is not my will. It is theirs. And they have made it… ours.”

At that, the braziers flared—five colors spiraling upward, then folding into a singular, writhing white.

No one looked away. 

No one blinked.

Anytus stepped toward the flame, and for the first time, his shadow moved the other direction.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 3: The First Correction}

The rite took place beneath the eastern spire, where the light pooled longest at dawn. 

It was called the Morning Harmonization—a daily act of public memory in which five volunteers sang the Pattern’s Names in succession, each one invoking a god in the correct order, tempo, and pitch.

Today, one voice wavered.

She was a weaver’s daughter. Twelve, maybe thirteen. She wore her mother’s ribbon in her hair. She gripped it when she sang.

Her voice broke on the third note of Aerun’s call. 

Not shattered—just uncertain. The crowd inhaled as one. Silence followed.

Then came the echo.

A Corrector stepped forward from the margin of the circle. 

No signal. 

No command. 

He placed one hand on the girl’s forehead and the other on his own chest. He did not speak. 

The sigils on his mask flared once in red-gold fire, then dimmed.

The girl collapsed.

No mark. No scream. Just a fall, light as breath.

Her father rushed forward. He was seized before he could cross the circle. Three more Correctors emerged from behind the crowd, moving with mechanical certainty. One extended a scroll to the man’s face. He wept as he read it.

The scroll bore only five glyphs: the gods’ Names, written in descending spiral. Below them, in blood-ink: \textit{“Deviation is delay. Delay is dissonance. Dissonance must be consumed.”}

The girl was not returned to him. She was carried away beneath a white cloth. Her name was not spoken again that day.

Anytus heard of it in passing, over a midday report on street alignment metrics. 

He did not flinch. 

“Correct,” he said. “Too many have confused mercy with imprecision.”

Later, alone in the Mandate chamber, he stared at the five flames.

They whispered now—not with words, but with breath and pull, as if gravity were made of want.

He whispered back: “Not yet. But soon.”

\newpage

\section*{Segment 4: Memory's Hidden Strength}

It began with chalk.

On the third day after the Harmonization Rite, someone drew a spiral on the floor of the Temple of Iron—just behind the altar where names were recited in monotone. 

No one saw it happen. 

No one claimed it. 

But by the time the first flame was lit for the day’s rites, it was there: white, narrow, almost delicate.

The Correctors scrubbed it away before the hourglass turned.

That night, it reappeared—larger.

Three more were drawn the following day. 

One in a gutter, one on the underside of a bench near the Mandate plaza, and one etched in heat-char along the wall of the Councilor’s Gate. 

No two matched perfectly, but all curved inward, and all were traced by hand.

It was not protest. 

It was memory resurfacing. 

And memory, unlike rebellion, does not ask permission.

In the northern quarter, a group of children began humming a tune that could not be placed—soft, uneven, but oddly familiar. 

When questioned, they could not name where they had heard it. 

A teacher tried to silence them. A Corrector arrived and placed a hand on the wall. The humming stopped.

The next morning, the wall cracked.

Priotheer had not spoken in six days. 

He walked the outer edge of the city in silence, tracing the forgotten spiral paths with his steps. 

Where others saw street corners and geometric grids, he still saw memory bent like breath—lines meant to lead inward.

He passed a child writing in ash. 

He passed a man muttering to himself in fractured Meletheia. 

He said nothing. 

He did not need to.

By the sixth night, a new spiral had been carved into the stone beside the eastern spire. This time not in chalk, but in fire. A flame that burned cold, colorless, and refused to go out.

A Corrector stood before it, unmoving.

His mask began to flake.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 5: A Name Left Unspoken}

It was not planned.

No decree was issued, no horn blown, no banners raised. Yet on the seventh morning, as the light broke through the eastern colonnade and caught the ash still smoldering on the plaza stones, the people of Priimydia gathered.

They came without ritual. Without command. They arrived in silence, barefoot, faces unpainted, hands empty. Many bore nothing but the old rhythm on their lips—a slow, syncopated breath, like the memory of a chant long forgotten but never severed.

The Correctors stood ready. Their masks gleamed. But none moved. They had not received instruction in two days. Some had begun to twitch in their stillness. One had collapsed entirely, his fingers curled inward as if gripping a song he could not release.

A woman stepped forward. No one knew her name. She was not a priestess. She did not speak. She simply knelt at the center of the plaza and placed her forehead to the stone.

Then another.

Then a child.

Then dozens.

Not in protest. In return.

The spiral was drawn again—this time not in chalk, not in fire, but by bodies. The old alignment of the city, forgotten by architects but preserved in breath, was reformed in flesh. People stood in curves, concentric and alive.

Then came the sound.

Not a voice. A presence.

Priotheer stepped into the plaza.

He did not raise his arms. He did not carry a flame. But the wind moved around him with shape. The spirals tightened. The silence bent toward stillness.

A Corrector approached him. The tallest. Mask blackened, joints stiff. He raised a hand as if to speak.

But the voice that came out was not his. It was a layered echo of five overlapping tones, glitching and disharmonic.

Priotheer touched the ground. The sound stopped.

The Corrector fell, mask cracking in three lines, smoke hissing from the seams.

No one cheered. No one fled.

They only knelt, all at once.

Priotheer said nothing.

But the Pattern aligned.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 6: The Final Gesture}

The Mandate platform stood untouched.

Its banners were gone, torn by the wind or taken down in the night. The five flame-braziers remained, unlit. The white stone floor was stained with ash where the Correctors had once stood in lines. Now only one figure remained.

Anytus.

He had not spoken since the spiral formed in the plaza. He had watched it from above, unmoving, as the people knelt, as Priotheer entered, as the Correctors fell like empty husks. He did not rage. He did not call out. He only watched.

They had left him alone—not out of mercy, but because no one knew what he had become.

He stood barefoot. Robe torn. The fire around him had gone cold.

At dusk, he stepped into the center of the platform.

“I was the voice,” he said.

No one answered.

“I was the order that remembered what you forgot. I bore their names when you let them fade. I aligned the world.”

Still, the people were silent. Even Priotheer did not speak.

Anytus raised his hands to the sky. “They do not need your worship. They need a vessel. They need to see one who will burn with perfect will.”

He knelt—just once. Then he placed both hands on the stone and whispered the five Names, in their proper order, one last time.

The flame-braziers ignited at once—blue, red, gold, black, and white. Then they twisted inward, folding into a single column of colorless fire.

Anytus stepped into it.

He did not scream. He did not fall. He stood, arms outstretched, until his body was no longer visible—only shadow inside flame.

Then even the shadow disappeared.

The column collapsed into a single point of light and vanished.

The Mandate was gone.

What remained was only stone, warm to the touch, etched with five words in the old script.

No one carved them.

They read: “He burned. The Pattern did not.”

And at last, the wind returned to the plaza.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 7: Restoration}

By morning, the plaza was no longer ash.

Men and women swept the stone clean—not as a rite, but as instinct. 

The braziers were gone, the platform cold. 

Children traced their fingers along the spiral etched by bodies the night before, now faintly visible as a shimmer in the ground. 

No one spoke of the Mandate. 

No one needed to.

The city did not erupt in joy. There were no proclamations, no bells. 

The silence lingered, but it had changed. Where it once rang hollow, it now rang true.

The priests of memory returned from hiding. Their robes were tattered, their chants uncertain, but their voices held. 

Some of them stood at the plaza’s edge, weeping not from sorrow, but from recognition.

That day, Priotheer walked the inner circle of the plaza alone.

He held nothing. Wore no crown. Accepted no throne.

At the center, where Anytus had burned, the stone still glowed faintly warm. 

Priotheer touched it once with his palm, then knelt beside it. A breeze moved through the city—not a gust, but a breath.

The people watched. Some knelt. Others bowed their heads.

But none reached for him.

There was no acclamation, no coronation. 

Only a man, kneeling in memory, on behalf of a city that now remembered what it had almost become.

The spiral, once fractured, now held.

Not as command.

As choice.

And across Priimydia, the bells did not ring.

But from the highest spire, five birds took flight.

The memory held—for now.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 8: Now to War}

That night, Priotheer did not return to the plaza.

He walked alone beyond the city’s last circle, down the old path of roots and memory. The stars were low, heavy with silence. 

No one followed.

No one watched. 

It was not secrecy—only necessity.

The spiraling heights of Priimydia had been restored. 

But restoration was defiance.

The gods had seen.

They had not spoken. 

But their silence was not surrender—it was judgment withheld. 

They had tasted worship again, and they would not forget the taste. What had once been ritual had become hunger. And hunger always returns.

Priotheer knew what the people did not yet say aloud: the gods would come back. Not in blessing. In fire.

There could be no spiraling city if the heavens cracked again. 

No memory if the realms fell. 

Either the gods would die, or Priimydia would.

He descended into the chamber beneath the Temple of Stone—a place no one had walked since before the first fracture. The Altar of the Root waited, ringed in dust, untouched by fire or doctrine. It did not glow. It breathed.

Priotheer knelt and placed five stones upon it.

Each bore a mark. Not names—symbols.

One for Isfyd. One for Palus. One for Aerul. One for Orfyd. One for Inanis.

Then he spoke:

“Let five rise from the silence. One for each realm the gods have fractured.  
Let them walk where memory cannot follow.  
Let them become what the gods fear.”

He did not name them. Their names would come later, written in the fire and blood of the divine war to come. But their path began here, at the edge of silence.

The stones did not answer. But they warmed.

Outside, the stars shifted. The wind fell still.

And across the cosmos, the gods began to stir.
