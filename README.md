#  The Priimydica

> *“Not merely a novel. Not merely a chronicle. This is recursion codified, soul mapped in descent, and the mythic threshold brought into ritual form.”*

## ❖ What This Is

**The Priimydica** is a long-form literary project — a Dostoyevskian-fantasy-ritual hybrid, built to explore:
- Metaphysical descent and transformation
- Symbolic encoding of moral and philosophical structure
- The architecture of myth and memory in narrative form

This is not a conventional novel.
It is structured like scripture, conflict like confession, and dialogue like theological warfare.

It is both a **work of art** and a **crafted product** —  
designed with narrative integrity, thematic cohesion, and philosophical intensity.  
Not sacred like the Bible, but **not casual either**. Its **severity demands attention**.

## ❖ Project Structure

- Divided into **5 Books**
- Each Book contains **Chapters** (3,000–5,000 words)
- Each Chapter contains **Segments** (400–800 words)
- Each Segment delivers a **mythic, symbolic, or ideological function**

## ❖ Current Books

- Book I: *The One and the Five*
- Book II: *The Fire-Walkers’ Oath*
- Book III: *The Looped World*
- Book IV: *The Circle and the Sword*
- Book V: *The War Against Death*

## ❖ Discretion Clause

This project is not sacred scripture —  
but it is **deliberate**, **layered**, and **severe**.
