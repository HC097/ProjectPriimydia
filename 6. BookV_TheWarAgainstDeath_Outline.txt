BOOK V: The War Against Death
=============================

A shadow from the forgotten realm rises. The empire trembles. Three broken heroes carry the last memory of Light toward the edge of the world.

Thematic Arc:
-------------
This book is a convergence. The sins of the past erupt into myth again, but the gods are gone — and so men must carry the burden. It is a final descent into entropy and resurrection, where memory, not power, determines who remains.
