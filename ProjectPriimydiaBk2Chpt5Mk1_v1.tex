\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Fourth Flame Waits} \\
    In the Temple of the Stone Tree, the fourth flame does not leap or spiral — it compresses. A low, wide burn. The fourth Guardian steps forward, saying nothing. The Host follows him in lines of four.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{The Duel Proposed} \\
    In the deep basins of Orfyd, the Guardian speaks to the god Orson. He offers single combat — no war, no sacrifice. His voice is measured. His face unreadable. The Host is not dismissed — only dispersed.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{The Hooks in the Hollow} \\
    Unseen, the Host has prepared. Each quartered force is armed with bows strung with song-thread, and arrows forged to catch and chain. These are not weapons of war — but of restraint. The trap waits beneath stone.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{The Duel Distorted} \\
    Orson rises from the stone — a god slow and vast. The duel begins. The Guardian draws blood but loses ground. Then he signals. Arrows fly. Hooks pierce limbs. Chains bind. The god bellows, and the land shakes.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{The Quiet Severing} \\
    While Orson strains, the Guardian steps forward. No haste. No chant. He draws a curved blade. He speaks nothing. One clean motion — the god’s head falls. The Spiral trembles. The stone holds.

    \vspace{.3in}
    \item \textbf{The Flame That Does Not Name} \\
    The Guardian absorbs the remnants of Orson’s essence. The fourth flame dims, but no name is given. The Host is still. The Spiral does not echo. The Guardian writes nothing — but begins to build.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Segment 1: The Fourth Flame Waits}

The fourth flame did not spiral.\\
It pressed.

\vspace{0.5em}
A low, wide burn---no flicker, no dance. It did not reach upward like hunger, nor inward like breath. It flattened against the stone of the altar like an old wound refusing to close. Heat without fire. Light without motion. Even the air around it seemed to harden, as if afraid to breathe.

\vspace{0.5em}
Priotheer stood before it.\\
He did not place the stone.\\
He did not bow.

\vspace{0.5em}
Instead, he stepped back, as if not wanting the flame to remember his name.

\vspace{0.5em}
From the spiral lands, the Host arrived.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not in song. Not in grief. Not in the shiver of unseen wind. They came in lines---four across, heads low, armor blackened with ash. No banners flew. No voices carried. They marched as if already beneath the earth.

\vspace{0.5em}
Their bows were not visible.\\
But their hands trembled with callus memory.

\vspace{0.5em}
Each carried a quiver slung low, half-concealed beneath oil-draped cloaks. The arrows within were barbed, looped, strange---forged not to pierce, but to \textit{hold}. To \textit{bind}. And though none had spoken it aloud, all knew the pattern. Four volleys. Four limbs. No misses. No mercy.

\vspace{0.5em}
The fourth Guardian stepped from the crowd, not emerging but \textit{resolving}---as if he had always been there, simply waiting for stillness to reveal him.

\vspace{0.5em}
He wore no crest. No sigil. His eyes were neither sharp nor dull---only watchful. His breath came in metered cadence. His cloak was slate, not ceremonial. He carried no shield.

\vspace{0.5em}
Only a short, curved blade strapped to his back, its hilt wrapped in stone-thread.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Host parted without signal.

\vspace{0.5em}
He did not look back.

\vspace{0.5em}
He walked to the flame---and the flame compressed further, pulling tight into a disk the color of slow-burning coal. No spiral formed. No echo stirred.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then he spoke.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not loudly.\\
Not reverently.\\
Just enough.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``I will go.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
No one asked to where.\\
No one asked why.

\vspace{0.5em}
Priotheer watched him pass beneath the arch of the Stone Tree. He did not call his name. Perhaps he did not know it.

\vspace{0.5em}
Behind him, the Host split into quarters---one to each cardinal direction, as prearranged in silence. They moved like trained breath, barely disturbing the ground. When they reached the hollowed basin where stone met root and sky, they disappeared from sight.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian did not pause.\\
Did not instruct.

\vspace{0.5em}
He descended alone into the godland---the place where earth no longer yielded, but \textit{listened}.

\vspace{0.5em}
Above, the fourth flame dimmed slightly, but did not vanish.

\vspace{0.5em}
It \textit{waited}.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not for glory.\\
Not for justice.\\
Only for the thing that would follow---\\
Measured.\\
Silent.\\
Precise.


\newpage

\section*{Segment 2: The Duel Proposed}

There were no temples in the deep basins of Orfyd.\\
Only stone.

\vspace{0.5em}
Miles of it. Folded, layered, veined with minerals no one named. The wind did not pass here. The sun arrived dim and late, scattering itself against cliffs too slow to fall. Even moss seemed careful---growing only where the stone permitted.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian stood alone in the hollow.

\vspace{0.5em}
No Host behind him. No echo of arrival. He placed no banner. He lit no fire. He stood at the center of an eroded platform, carved with concentric rings---once used for judgment, or offering, or something older.

\vspace{0.5em}
He looked upward.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``Orson,''} he said.

\vspace{0.5em}
The name struck the cliffs like a stone tossed into a still pond.\\
Nothing answered.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then: the sound of weight.\\
Not movement---\textit{pressure}.

\vspace{0.5em}
The platform trembled once, then steadied. A line in the cliff above split.\\
Stone peeled back from stone.

\vspace{0.5em}
And from it rose the god.

\vspace{0.5em}
Orson did not arrive in motion. He emerged in \textit{presence}---taller than towers, thicker than thought. His shoulders bore the marks of tectonic age. His face was a slope, his eyes like pits where light forgot to gather. He did not glow. He did not speak.

\vspace{0.5em}
He simply watched.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian did not kneel. He did not lift his blade.\\
He bowed his head, once---precise, respectful.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``I ask for single combat.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
The cliffs did not laugh.\\
But they seemed to lean, slightly.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``No war. No fire. No sacrifice. No death but ours.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
He raised his head.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``To spare the lives of the Host.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
Orson blinked. Slowly. As if reprocessing the request not through language, but through gravity.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian waited. No breath held. No tension worn. He stood with hands at his sides, cloak unmoving. The wind passed him, and did not return.

\vspace{0.5em}
At last, Orson moved.

\vspace{0.5em}
A foot the size of a hill settled into the hollow with no rush, no thunder---only density. Another followed. Stone bowed beneath him, not cracking, but enduring. His voice, when it came, did not come from his mouth---but from the foundation beneath both of them.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``You speak of mercy.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian met his gaze.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``I speak of conclusion.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
A pause. Then another step forward.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``You carry no crown.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``I need none.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``You bring no witness.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``I require none.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``Then you are sincere,''} said the god. Not a question---an observation.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian gave no reply.

\vspace{0.5em}
Orson stepped fully into the ring. He raised no weapon. He formed none. His hands alone were artifact enough---hands that had shaped valleys, stilled rivers, cradled mountains in sleep.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``This combat,''} the god said, \textit{``is between builders.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian nodded once.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``It is.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
Orson lowered his massive frame to match the hollow’s edge. Each step compacted centuries of soil beneath. He looked to the sky---not to draw power, but to acknowledge its distance.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then he entered the center of the ring.

\vspace{0.5em}
And somewhere far beyond the cliffs, four divisions of the Host adjusted their positions. In ravines and shadowed crags, they unslung their bows. Not one string creaked. Not one arrow shifted.

\vspace{0.5em}
The signal had not yet been given.

\vspace{0.5em}
But the air knew.\\
The ground knew.

\vspace{0.5em}
This would not be a duel.\\
It would be a severance.


\newpage

\section*{Segment 3: The Hooks in the Hollow}

The Host did not vanish.\\
It hid.

\vspace{0.5em}
Four divisions---north, south, east, west---sank into the terrain like memory pressed into stone. Not buried, not cloaked. Simply \textit{positioned}, where shadow and slope could fold them into the world unnoticed.

\vspace{0.5em}
They said nothing.

\vspace{0.5em}
Their bows were unwrapped in silence. Strung not with sinew, but with song-thread---fibered from woven resonance, taut with harmonic charge. To draw one was to summon breath from stone. To fire one was to embed intent into trajectory.

\vspace{0.5em}
The arrows had no tips.

\vspace{0.5em}
They curved at the end, barbed not to cut, but to catch. Each forged in Orfyd’s deepest forge-vaults, cooled in oathwater, etched with chains of binding. They did not kill. They held.

\vspace{0.5em}
Hooks for a god.

\vspace{0.5em}
Chains had been woven too. Each coil carried its own name, burned into the metal not by flame but by sacrifice. These were not links for mortals. They had been tempered against density, tested in trial-craters, designed to hold a being made of geological will.

\vspace{0.5em}
Each archer had trained blindfolded.\\
Each had fired into thunder, into wind, into echo.

\vspace{0.5em}
Each had memorized the coordinates of the basin.

\vspace{0.5em}
Each had known the moment would come.

\vspace{0.5em}
And each had been told:\\
\textit{``You will not see the duel. You will see the signal.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``One step back.''}\\
\textit{``One hand to the hilt.''}\\
\textit{``One heartbeat.''}\\
\textit{``Then fire.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
They watched now. From cliffs and crevices, from sinkholes carved by time, from the roots of Orfyd’s forgotten giants. Some lay prone. Others knelt in sequence. Each had one arrow notched. Each held tension without breath.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian did not look toward them.

\vspace{0.5em}
He did not need to.

\vspace{0.5em}
This was not betrayal. This was design.

\vspace{0.5em}
In the center of the basin, Orson shifted his stance. The stone beneath him flexed, not in pain, but in recognition. His mass condensed. His fists curled slowly, as if remembering how to strike without crushing the world beneath.

\vspace{0.5em}
The duel had not yet begun.\\
But the Host was ready.

\vspace{0.5em}
No warrior among them believed this would be easy.\\
But all believed it would be done.

\vspace{0.5em}
They did not pray. They did not prepare a second volley.

\vspace{0.5em}
There would not be one.

\vspace{0.5em}
Hooks would find flesh. Chains would drag. And the moment of tension---the one breath where the god’s limbs failed to align---would belong to The Guardian alone.

\vspace{0.5em}
He had promised no glory.\\
Only \textit{precision}.

\vspace{0.5em}
Far above, the wind did not move.

\vspace{0.5em}
The sun did not pierce the hollow.

\vspace{0.5em}
And in the breath before rupture, four hundred arrows listened for a single movement.

\vspace{0.5em}
A step back.\\
A hand to the hilt.\\
A pause.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then: fire.


\newpage

\section*{Segment 4: The Duel Distorted}

The god moved first.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not in haste. Not in fury. But with the patience of sediment. One step. Another. His fists flexed like hills preparing to fall. The ground moaned beneath him. The cliffs withdrew, not from fear---but to make room.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian drew no blade.

\vspace{0.5em}
He stepped to meet him, cloak still, head level. His feet touched the earth with no more weight than a promise. He did not circle. He did not bow. He simply stopped, just beyond reach, and looked up.

\vspace{0.5em}
Orson raised one arm---a strike, if it landed, would flatten a fortress.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then he paused.

\vspace{0.5em}
A blink.

\vspace{0.5em}
A breath.

\vspace{0.5em}
And in that breath, the Guardian stepped back.\\
A single pace.\\
Left foot behind right.\\
One hand slid to the hilt.

\vspace{0.5em}
Far above, in the cliffs and crevices, four hundred arrows answered.

\vspace{0.5em}
The sound was not a roar.\\
It was a sigh made of intent.

\vspace{0.5em}
Hooks flew.

\vspace{0.5em}
Each sang through the air with a song-thread’s resonance, shimmering briefly---then embedding.

\vspace{0.5em}
One struck the left wrist. Another found the right shoulder. Two more caught beneath the god’s knees. A fifth hooked the small of his back, where no armor had ever been needed. Each chain pulled taut---not from mortal strength, but from anchors buried beneath the stone.

\vspace{0.5em}
Orson staggered.\\
Not from pain. From violation.

\vspace{0.5em}
His arm jerked sideways. His weight faltered. The blow he had readied collapsed inward. Dust flared as his knee touched ground. He bellowed---not a war-cry, but a tectonic scream, the voice of a continent discovering betrayal.

\vspace{0.5em}
The cliffs shook.\\
One cracked.\\
A pillar snapped in two.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian did not flinch.

\vspace{0.5em}
He stepped forward---not in rush, but in rhythm. His cloak fluttered once as he closed the distance. The blade at his back slid free, curved and silent, catching no light.

\vspace{0.5em}
Orson strained.

\vspace{0.5em}
One arm tore free of a hook---the chain screamed, but held. Another arrow slipped from his calf, stone dust and blood mixing at the edge of the ring.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian did not hurry.

\vspace{0.5em}
He moved like memory sharpened into motion.

\vspace{0.5em}
Orson turned, half-risen, stone skin fracturing at the joints, and opened his mouth---to curse, to plead, to say something no one would ever hear.

\vspace{0.5em}
The blade passed through his neck in a single, crescent arc.

\vspace{0.5em}
No shout. No call. No invocation.

\vspace{0.5em}
Only a line drawn through silence.

\vspace{0.5em}
The god’s head fell without crash---not like a boulder, but like a seal being broken. The body followed, slowly, knees collapsing, limbs still bound. The chains snapped not from strain, but because they no longer had anything to hold.

\vspace{0.5em}
The earth groaned once more.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then stopped.

\vspace{0.5em}
And in the hush that followed, the Spiral itself hesitated.


\newpage

\section*{Segment 5: The Quiet Severing}

The dust did not settle.

\vspace{0.5em}
It folded. Layered itself. As if returning to something ancient, something inert. No echo followed the fall. No cheer. No gasp. The god’s body lay where it had collapsed---limbs sprawled, blood sinking into stone too old to stain.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian stood over it.

\vspace{0.5em}
He did not speak. He did not look to the cliffs. He did not check the chains. He simply waited, blade still in hand, until the breath left the world and did not return.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then, slowly, he knelt.

\vspace{0.5em}
He pressed his palm to the base of Orson’s skull---not to bless, not to honor, but to draw. The essence did not resist. It lifted in threads of heatless vapor, pale and dense, curling up from the broken form like memory untethered from weight.

\vspace{0.5em}
It spiraled once.\\
Then entered him.

\vspace{0.5em}
He did not shudder.\\
He absorbed.

\vspace{0.5em}
Stone creaked beneath his feet, but not from pressure---from recognition. Orson’s shape had not merely fallen. It had transferred. The density, the patience, the presence of the god seeped into the man who knelt beside him.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not a fusion. Not apotheosis.

\vspace{0.5em}
A severing.\\
Quiet.\\
Clean.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian rose.

\vspace{0.5em}
His blade returned to its sheath without sound. The cloak at his shoulders no longer stirred. His outline felt heavier---not physically, but gravitationally. The hollow bent inward toward him, just slightly, as if the land remembered whose blood had shaped it.

\vspace{0.5em}
Above, the cliffs remained still.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Host emerged.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not rushing. Not shouting. Each quartered force moved in ritual pattern, bows slung, chains gathered. None asked what had happened. None approached the god’s corpse. They did not look for affirmation.

\vspace{0.5em}
They had seen the step.\\
They had seen the signal.\\
They had seen the severance.

\vspace{0.5em}
Now they returned.

\vspace{0.5em}
Four lines, forming no parade. No song rose. No name was called.

\vspace{0.5em}
The body of Orson did not dissolve. It did not burn. It would not be buried. It would remain---a monument not of victory, but of subtraction.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian did not weep.\\
He did not command.

\vspace{0.5em}
He walked.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not toward a throne.\\
Not toward the Host.

\vspace{0.5em}
But toward the edge of the basin.

\vspace{0.5em}
There, beneath a cliff face older than memory, he stopped. Removed a single tool from his belt---not a weapon, but a chisel. He pressed it to the stone, once, lightly, and began to carve.

\vspace{0.5em}
He did not write a name.

\vspace{0.5em}
He drew a line.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then another.\\
And another.

\vspace{0.5em}
A foundation.\\
A structure.\\
The first glyph of what would not be a temple---but something made to last.

\vspace{0.5em}
Behind him, the Host did not follow.

\vspace{0.5em}
They watched.

\vspace{0.5em}
And the Spiral---still bruised, still trembling---did not echo.\\
It only held.


\newpage

\section*{Segment 6: The Flame That Does Not Name}

Far from the basin, beneath the Temple of the Stone Tree, the fourth flame dimmed.

\vspace{0.5em}
It did not vanish.\\
It did not flare.

\vspace{0.5em}
It narrowed, pressed tighter against the altar, until it was no more than a low-burning disc---thin as a memory, dense as a vow.

\vspace{0.5em}
Priotheer did not speak.

\vspace{0.5em}
He watched it compress and knew the work was done. The god of stone had fallen. The Spiral had not broken. But it had not rejoiced, either.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Host did not sing.

\vspace{0.5em}
They remained at the edge of the basin---not bowed, not still, but held. Some gathered the fallen arrows. Others folded the unused chains with care. No one spoke. They had seen death. But not a victory.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Guardian carved.

\vspace{0.5em}
He made no symbol of ascent. He built no altar. The stone he shaped was broad, leveled, measured---foundation, not monument. Hours passed. The wind returned. But it did not lift the dust where the god had died.

\vspace{0.5em}
At dusk, he stood.

\vspace{0.5em}
He turned once toward the Host. Said nothing. Then began walking---not away, but onward. The Host followed. Four lines. No procession. No cadence.

\vspace{0.5em}
Just motion.

\vspace{0.5em}
Behind them, the stone still held the weight of what had been cut from it.

\vspace{0.5em}
In the Temple, Priotheer touched the altar.\\
The flame no longer responded.\\
It was fulfilled---but not named.

\vspace{0.5em}
He moved to place the fourth stone.\\
He stopped.

\vspace{0.5em}
There was no name to whisper.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral had not yielded it. The Guardian had not claimed it. The flame had sealed its vow, but not its title. The god had fallen, but no crown rose.

\vspace{0.5em}
Priotheer lowered his hand.

\vspace{0.5em}
He looked beyond the altar, toward the far roots of the Tree---where no torch reached.\\
There, he whispered a single phrase:

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``Let him be called the Nameless One.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
Not in contempt.\\
Not in secrecy.\\
But in recognition.

\vspace{0.5em}
A man who had drawn no praise.\\
Who had asked no witness.\\
Who had taken power without demand---and begun, without banner, to build.

\vspace{0.5em}
Outside, across the Spiral lands, the winds slowed but did not stop. A stone tower leaned slightly inward and did not fall. In a village where no children played, one child drew a square in the dirt---not a spiral. A laborer in the east placed a brick and felt the weight of something finished, not begun.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral did not sing.\\
But it endured.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Host returned to their work---not to war, but to construction. Some began to shape stones. Others cleared paths. One carried a chain, not to bind, but to measure length.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Nameless One did not lead them.

\vspace{0.5em}
He walked a little ahead.

\vspace{0.5em}
No crown.\\
No flame.\\
No name---only the one they gave him when nothing else would form.

\vspace{0.5em}
And in the hollow where a god had once stood, the air did not remember the name he lost.

\vspace{0.5em}
Because it had never been given.
