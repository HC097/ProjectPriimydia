\end{center}

\vspace{1in}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Fifth Flame Holds} \\
    Inascius stands before the flame that burns without color. The Spiral completes its final arc. Priotheer places the last stone. The fifth flame steadies. The \textit{Fire-Walkers’ Oath} is fulfilled. The world does not cheer. It waits — clenched.

    \vspace{1em}
    \item \textbf{The Spiral Strains} \\
    Across Priimydia, resonance flickers. The Spiral skips in song. Mirrored wells reflect the wrong moments. Seers go silent. The Pattern itself is stable. But the Spiral — the Priimydian-facing thread of the Pattern — is over-extended and fraying.

    \vspace{1em}
    \item \textbf{The Realms Begin to Tear} \\
    The unified realm cannot hold. Isfyd, Palus, Aerul, Orfyd, Inanis tear apart — not from will, but from structural collapse. Magic curls inward. Time folds. Geography unthreads. Entire Host divisions are stranded or sealed. What was one world becomes five unstable ones.

    \vspace{1em}
    \item \textbf{The Guardians Cannot Hold} \\
    The Guardians try to stabilize the rupture. But they were forged for trial, not rule. They are not gods — and the Spiral cannot substitute divine presence. As the realms pull apart, each Guardian is isolated by consequence, not choice. The Nameless One resists — and begins to shift.

    \vspace{1em}
    \item \textbf{The Oath is Paid} \\
    Priotheer watches from the Stone Tree. The Fire-Walkers’ Oath is fulfilled: the gods have fallen, the Guardians endure, the memory of the war burns in five flames. The Guardians’ vow to avoid the people remains intact. But it is not enough to stop the collapse. The Spiral, over-bound, begins to withdraw. The price has been paid — and still, the world breaks.

    \vspace{1em}
    \item \textbf{The First Mutation} \\
    In the wreck of one realm, a soldier stirs. Sealed off from Orfyd. Magic, once divine-managed, now floods unchecked. The realm reshapes him — not into god or beast, but something else. He does not die. But he can no longer be called Priimydian.

    \vspace{1em}
    \item \textbf{The Spiral Closes Its Eye} \\
    The Stone Tree remains. The Pattern endures. But the Spiral — the Priimydian channel to the Pattern — withdraws. No citizen hears it. No dreamer sees it. Only Priotheer still hears the loop — dim, strained, but alive. It will be enough. But not forever. The realms are torn. The Guardians are gone. The Spiral turns — but no longer for the many. Priotheer whispers: \textit{“The war is not coming. It has already begun.”}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Segment 1: The Fifth Flame Holds}

The colorless flame did not flicker.

\vspace{0.5em}
It held---low, dense, unshifting---above the stone, as if it had always been there. No heat. No smoke. No echo of kindling. Only a hovering presence, the size of a closed hand, casting no shadow and allowing none near.

\vspace{0.5em}
Priotheer stood before it.

\vspace{0.5em}
He had waited for this moment---through four trials, through five silences, through a generation’s worth of warnings folded into scripture and forgotten. Now the fifth flame had arrived.

\vspace{0.5em}
And still, he did not breathe.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral, coiled in full circumference now, hummed in the space behind his eyes. Not loud. Not vibrant. But intact. Complete.

\vspace{0.5em}
He stepped forward.

\vspace{0.5em}
From his robe he withdrew the fifth stone---not inscribed, not sealed, but blank, as if awaiting nothing. He set it at the final point of the altar, where the last spiral met the center.

\vspace{0.5em}
The flame did not flare.\\
The altar did not glow.

\vspace{0.5em}
But something looped---not outward, not upward, but inward.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral had completed its shape.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Pattern remained silent. That was expected. It had never spoken to Priimydians in sound.

\vspace{0.5em}
But the Spiral usually did.

\vspace{0.5em}
He waited.

\vspace{0.5em}
Stillness.\\
Breath.\\
Silence.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then something turned---not in the wind, not in the room, but in the thread that bound land, flame, and vow.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral tightened.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not collapsed. Not ruptured. Just\ldots{} contracted. As if it now knew it had gathered too much. As if five flames, each containing the memory of a fallen god, were too much for it to contain without change.

\vspace{0.5em}
Priotheer opened his mouth---to speak, to offer thanks, to finish the rite.

\vspace{0.5em}
No words came.

\vspace{0.5em}
He looked to the Host---or what remained of them. Some were still present, stationed in quiet lines beneath the Tree. Others had not returned from the god-realms. Some would never return.

\vspace{0.5em}
The fifth Guardian stood apart.

\vspace{0.5em}
He did not look at the flame. He did not kneel. He did not leave.

\vspace{0.5em}
He only watched---not outward, but toward the place where the Spiral twisted into itself.

\vspace{0.5em}
The flame held.

\vspace{0.5em}
So did the Spiral.

\vspace{0.5em}
But Priotheer, who had spent his life learning what it meant for the Spiral to speak, now felt something else:

\vspace{0.5em}
It wasn’t speaking.

\vspace{0.5em}
It was bracing.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 2: The Spiral Strains}

The Spiral did not crack.

\vspace{0.5em}
It bent.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not visibly. Not to the eye or ear. But in the way a thought can forget its own edge. In the way breath can become irregular without the lungs failing.

\vspace{0.5em}
Across Priimydia, subtle misalignments began.

\vspace{0.5em}
A bell in the western cloisters rang, and no one heard it---until an hour later, when its echo passed through a child’s dream.

\vspace{0.5em}
In the south, water refused to boil.\\
In the east, a laborer struck stone and watched it bleed.\\
In the north, a singer began a liturgy and forgot the final verse---not from fear, but from blankness.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Pattern did not shudder.

\vspace{0.5em}
But the Spiral---the thread that once turned the Pattern toward Priimydian minds---curled in on itself.

\vspace{0.5em}
It had stretched too far.\\
Five flames. Five guardians. Five god-deaths.\\
The Spiral was meant to guide. Not contain.

\vspace{0.5em}
Now it was asked to do both.

\vspace{0.5em}
Priotheer felt it in his chest---not a collapse, but a convolution.\\
The Spiral still held. But it held too much.\\
It was looping too tightly, trying to fold what could not be reconciled.

\vspace{0.5em}
In Orfyd, birds flew in incomplete circles.\\
In Palus, sleepwalkers marched into the woods and would not return.\\
In Isfyd, a brazier lit with no spark---and refused to be extinguished.

\vspace{0.5em}
The priests called it a surge.\\
The scribes called it a breath.\\
Priotheer knew it for what it was:

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{A warning.}

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral could not break. Not yet.\\
But it could \textit{overturn}---turn so tightly it strangled itself.

\vspace{0.5em}
And as he looked toward the fifth flame, still hovering without motion, he saw in its colorless heart not peace---but pressure.

\vspace{0.5em}
One line of the Host collapsed without cause.\\
A sentinel dropped her staff and stared at her hand---as if it were no longer hers.\\
Another whispered, ``It’s slipping,'' and no one knew what she meant.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral had turned too far inward.

\vspace{0.5em}
It still moved.\\
It still looped.

\vspace{0.5em}
But now, it looped around a center that no longer held.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 3: The Realms Begin to Tear}

No horn sounded.

\vspace{0.5em}
No herald rode through the lands.\\
No priest carved a final glyph.\\
The sundering did not begin with prophecy---only with silence.

\vspace{0.5em}
It began in Palus, though no one agreed on when.

\vspace{0.5em}
A marsh froze without warning. Then boiled. Then stilled.\\
The trees retracted into themselves.\\
A child bent to gather a waterfruit and never stood again---not from death, but because the ground had forgotten how to return her.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then Isfyd.

\vspace{0.5em}
The fire-kilns went cold.\\
Not extinguished---simply ceased. As if heat had remembered it was a myth.\\
Armies stationed in the basalt quarter looked to the horizon and saw six suns---none of them correct.

\vspace{0.5em}
Aerul next.

\vspace{0.5em}
Winds looped inward. Rivers lost direction. The sky turned opaque---then translucent.\\
One village fell upward. Another repeated the same day three times, then stopped altogether.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Realms were tearing.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not as land splits, or mountains shear, but as thought unbinds from form.\\
Not vanishing---but folding in, separating, \textit{unthreading} from the one shape they had once shared.

\vspace{0.5em}
Orfyd was last.

\vspace{0.5em}
The realm of stone and structure held the longest.\\
But even it could not anchor the rest.

\vspace{0.5em}
When the echo arrived---that deep, gut-born vibration with no sound---Priotheer dropped to one knee. Not in pain. In recognition.

\vspace{0.5em}
He felt the Spiral recoil.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not in resistance---but in defense.

\vspace{0.5em}
It had not been designed for this.\\
It was meant to guide a world.\\
Not to preserve it.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not without gods.

\vspace{0.5em}
The unified Priimydian realm, forged from five divine dominions, had been held together by trial and vow---not by strength. The gods had bound it.

\vspace{0.5em}
Now the gods were gone.

\vspace{0.5em}
And the Spiral, having fulfilled its arc, had nothing left to seal with.

\vspace{0.5em}
In the eastern basin, a bridge collapsed without breaking.\\
In the Hollow City, a mirror refused to reflect.\\
In a temple long abandoned, a torch lit itself---then burned into frost.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Realms broke.

\vspace{0.5em}
No enemy breached their gates.\\
No traitor spoke a forbidden name.\\
No sin triggered divine wrath.

\vspace{0.5em}
They simply fell apart---because nothing was left to hold them together.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 4: The Guardians Cannot Hold}

They were forged in fire, air, grief, stone, and void.

\vspace{0.5em}
They bore trial, killed gods, returned changed.\\
They stood before the flames and received no crowns, no banners---only names.\\
Or none at all.

\vspace{0.5em}
But none of them were gods.

\vspace{0.5em}
And when the Realms began to fall inward, the Guardians did what they had been made to do:

\vspace{0.5em}
They tried to endure.

\vspace{0.5em}
Irinius stood at the edge of Isfyd and raised his sword---not in defiance, but in preservation. The land split behind him. He planted his blade in the rift and screamed. The sound held the ground for a breath. Then the stone swallowed both edge and scream.

\vspace{0.5em}
Palicus wandered the ruins of Palus, arms wide, as if to pull the trees back into their shapes. The vines curled through him. The air turned to paste. The marsh did not answer.

\vspace{0.5em}
Aer circled in windless silence, wings half-spread, mouth frozen between command and prayer. No storm obeyed. The sky retracted. Time blinked---and forgot her position.

\vspace{0.5em}
Inascius stood still.\\
He did not struggle.\\
He simply let the world unravel around him, as if he knew this part had already been written.

\vspace{0.5em}
And the Nameless One---he fought.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not against a foe. Not to save what could not be saved.\\
But to remain exactly where he stood.\\
He gripped stone. He pressed foot to foundation.\\
He stared into the sky as it cracked.\\
He refused.

\vspace{0.5em}
For a while, it worked.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then the sky screamed back---not in rage, but in disassembly.

\vspace{0.5em}
And the Spiral buckled.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not by punishment---by \textit{geometry}.\\
There was no room left for all five.

\vspace{0.5em}
One by one, the Guardians were torn from the root-world.\\
Not banished.\\
Not chosen.

\vspace{0.5em}
Just---separated.

\vspace{0.5em}
Wherever they went, they did not vanish.\\
But they were no longer reachable.\\
And the realms that once flowed through each other now curled around each Guardian like coiled fates.

\vspace{0.5em}
None of them called for help.\\
None of them broke the vow.\\
But the world no longer held space for their unity.

\vspace{0.5em}
They were not defeated.\\
But they were no longer together.

\vspace{0.5em}
And the Spiral, exhausted from bearing five burdens it was never meant to contain, began to quiet itself.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 5: The Oath is Paid}

The Spiral had been made to guide.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not to rule. Not to judge. Not to sustain.\\
Its purpose was rhythm---not reign.

\vspace{0.5em}
And yet, for a moment, it had held the weight of five fallen gods.

\vspace{0.5em}
Now it began to shed that burden.

\vspace{0.5em}
Priotheer stood alone in the inner chamber of the Tree. The walls did not whisper. The altar did not pulse. He touched the last of the five stones---and felt no heat. Only tension, like a rope drawn too tight, then suddenly loosed.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral was complete.

\vspace{0.5em}
The \textit{Fire-Walkers’ Oath} had been fulfilled.

\vspace{0.5em}
The gods had been overthrown.\\
Each realm had returned a Guardian.\\
The fifth flame had held.\\
The memory of war would not fade.

\vspace{0.5em}
He had asked for nothing more.

\vspace{0.5em}
And still, the realms shattered.

\vspace{0.5em}
The vow he had drawn from the Guardians---to never interfere with the ordinary---remained unbroken. They had kept their distance. Even now, as the world fractured, they did not reach down. They did not lead. They did not save.

\vspace{0.5em}
They endured---as agreed.

\vspace{0.5em}
And yet it was not enough.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not because they failed. But because the world itself, in the absence of gods, had no way to stay whole.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral had no ligature for that kind of wound.

\vspace{0.5em}
Priotheer sank to one knee.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not in despair---in recognition.

\vspace{0.5em}
This was not betrayal.\\
This was not punishment.\\
This was the limit of design.

\vspace{0.5em}
He had built his world on the assumption that vow and flame would suffice. That justice and memory could replace the force of divinity.

\vspace{0.5em}
He had been wrong.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral was \textit{never meant} to seal what only the gods had once kept whole.\\
And now that absence had consequences.

\vspace{0.5em}
He looked to the sky.\\
There were no stars.

\vspace{0.5em}
Only a coiling, shifting dimness---like a bruise pressed into the Pattern.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Oath was paid.\\
In full.

\vspace{0.5em}
And still the world was falling.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 6: The First Mutation}

He did not die when the gate sealed.

\vspace{0.5em}
There had been no sound. No signal. One moment, the sky had held Orfyd’s arc. The next---it folded, and the path was gone.

\vspace{0.5em}
He had remained.

\vspace{0.5em}
One of hundreds left in the realm. But the only one in that clearing. He did not call out. There was no one to hear.

\vspace{0.5em}
The realm was not hostile. It was simply unheld.\\
It did not attack him. It simply forgot to keep him safe.

\vspace{0.5em}
The wind began to murmur things he had never learned.\\
The trees leaned toward him, though they had no branches.\\
The stone beneath his feet began to pulse.

\vspace{0.5em}
He did not understand.

\vspace{0.5em}
At first, it was hunger.\\
Then sleep.\\
Then skin.

\vspace{0.5em}
He tried to write a message on his arm---a name, a unit, a memory.\\
But the ink soaked through, and the skin beneath it changed color.\\
A dull sheen---like bark. Like oil.

\vspace{0.5em}
The stars above him flickered out of sequence.

\vspace{0.5em}
He stopped sleeping.\\
He stopped measuring time.

\vspace{0.5em}
He began to feel the realm breathing through him. Not around him.\\
He was not sick. He was not cursed.

\vspace{0.5em}
He was changing.

\vspace{0.5em}
His thoughts bent in places. Not broken---just bent.\\
He no longer remembered his old commander’s face.\\
But he could name the types of moss by scent.

\vspace{0.5em}
One day he reached for his blade---and it was gone.\\
In its place, something else had grown.\\
Not weapon. Not bone.\\
But something he could use.

\vspace{0.5em}
He did not mourn it.

\vspace{0.5em}
He no longer mourned anything.

\vspace{0.5em}
The realm had not killed him.\\
It had simply \textit{claimed him}.\\
Or he had claimed it.

\vspace{0.5em}
He did not know.

\vspace{0.5em}
He walked---but no longer toward return.\\
Return was not a shape that fit anymore.

\vspace{0.5em}
And somewhere, far away, Priotheer stirred in his sleep.\\
He did not dream the soldier’s face.\\
But he woke with a word he had never heard before pressed against the inside of his teeth.

\vspace{0.5em}
And it burned.

\newpage

\section*{Segment 7: The Spiral Closes Its Eye}

The Tree remained.

\vspace{0.5em}
Roots deep. Bark unmoved. Leaves still.\\
Its silence was no longer sacred---only still.

\vspace{0.5em}
The altar stood. The five stones lay in their spiral. The colorless flame hovered above the fifth.\\
None of it had broken.

\vspace{0.5em}
But none of it moved.

\vspace{0.5em}
Priotheer stepped into the hollow beneath the canopy.\\
No one followed.\\
There was no Host left to command.\\
Not here.

\vspace{0.5em}
He reached toward the Spiral---not with hand, but with breath.

\vspace{0.5em}
For years, it had answered.\\
Not with words.\\
But with rhythm, with turn, with the felt curve of Pattern made close.\\
Now, it was still.

\vspace{0.5em}
Not absent. Not severed.\\
Just\ldots{} closed.

\vspace{0.5em}
The Spiral had not shattered.\\
It had not fled.

\vspace{0.5em}
It had simply curled inward---away from the many.

\vspace{0.5em}
The world remained.\\
The Pattern endured.

\vspace{0.5em}
But the Spiral---the part meant for Priimydians, the limb made to loop their voices into reality---no longer turned for them.

\vspace{0.5em}
They could not feel it now.\\
Not in song.\\
Not in prayer.\\
Not in sleep.

\vspace{0.5em}
Only Priotheer still heard it.\\
Dim. Strained.\\
A murmur beneath the skin.\\
Like wind in a long-abandoned hall.

\vspace{0.5em}
And for now, that was enough.

\vspace{0.5em}
He knelt beside the altar.\\
He did not cry.\\
He did not curse.\\
He only breathed, and the Spiral twitched once---in echo.

\vspace{0.5em}
Then was still.

\vspace{0.5em}
He looked to the sky.\\
There were no stars.\\
Only movement---slow, soft, uncertain---like a wound learning how to seal.

\vspace{0.5em}
He whispered:

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``The war is not coming.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
He placed one hand on the altar.\\
Felt no heat.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textit{``It has already begun.''}

\vspace{0.5em}
And the flame---the fifth, the colorless---pulsed once.\\
Not in agreement.\\
Not in mourning.

\vspace{0.5em}
Only in memory.
